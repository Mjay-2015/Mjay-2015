I care about software that’s easier to build, change, and reason about.

Hi, I’m Natalie. I’m a generalist engineer working across
AI, machine learning, and software systems.

Most of my work focuses on the parts around the core idea:
interfaces, failure modes, evaluation, and maintainability.

### Selected projects

- **model-service**  
  A production-oriented CLI that treats ML models as dependencies.
  Focuses on contracts, fallbacks, and evaluation as system concerns.

- **service-skeleton**  
  A small FastAPI service template designed to stay easy to change.
  Emphasizes clear boundaries, validation at the edge, and boring defaults.

- **retrying**  
  A tiny retry/backoff utility with predictable behavior and strong tests.
  Failures happen — retries should be boring.

I value clarity, explicit tradeoffs, and software that holds up over time.
